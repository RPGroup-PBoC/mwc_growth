abstract = {Cell mass, the average number of nuclei/cell and the content of RNA and DNA were studied in Salmonella typhimurium during balanced (steady state) growth in different media. These quantities could be described as exponential functions of the growth rates afforded by the various media at a given temperature. The size and chemical composition characteristic of a given medium were not influenced by the temperature of cultivation. Thus, under conditions of balanced growth, this organism exists in one of a large number of possible stable physiological states. The variations in mass/cell are due to changes in the number of nuclei/cell as well as in mass/nucleus. An increase in the number of ribonucleoprotein particles at higher growth rates could, it appears, largely account for the increase in mass/nucleus. Calculations indicate that the rate of protein synthesis per unit RNA is nearly the same at all growth rates.},

@article{Rosenfeld2005,
abstract = {The quantitative relation between transcription factor concentrations and the rate of protein production from downstream genes is central to the function of genetic networks. Here we show that this relation, which we call the gene regulation function (GRF), fluctuates dynamically in individual living cells, thereby limiting the accuracy with which transcriptional genetic circuits can transfer signals. Using fluorescent reporter genes and fusion proteins, we characterized the bacteriophage lambda promoter P(R) in Escherichia coli. A novel technique based on binomial errors in protein partitioning enabled calibration of in vivo biochemical parameters in molecular units. We found that protein production rates fluctuate over a time scale of about one cell cycle, while intrinsic noise decays rapidly. Thus, biochemical parameters, noise, and slowly varying cellular states together determine the effective single-cell GRF. These results can form a basis for quantitative modeling of natural gene circuits and for design of synthetic ones.},

Here we use efficient protein extraction and sample fractionation, as well as state-of-the-art quantitative mass spectrometry techniques to generate a comprehensive, condition-dependent protein-abundance map for Escherichia coli. We measure cellular protein concentrations for 55{\%} of predicted E. coli genes ({\textgreater}2,300 proteins) under 22 different experimental conditions and identify methylation and N-terminal protein acetylations previously not known to be prevalent in bacteria. We uncover system-wide proteome allocation, expression regulation and post-translational adaptations.

@article{Liu2005a,
abstract = {By exploring global gene expression of Escherichia coli growing on six different carbon sources, we discov- ered a striking genome transcription pattern: as carbon substrate quality declines, cells systematically increase the number of genes expressed. Gene induction occurs in a hierarchical manner and includes many factors for uptake and metabolism of better but currently unavail- able carbon sources. Concomitantly, cells also increase their motility. Thus, as the growth potential of the envi- ronment decreases, cells appear to devote progressively more energy on the mere possibility of improving con- ditions. This adaptation is not what would be predicated by classic regulatory models alone. We also observe an inverse correlation between gene activation and rRNA synthesis suggesting that reapportioning RNA polymer- ase (RNAP) contributes to the expanded genome activa- tion. Significant differences in RNAP distribution in vivo, monitored using an RNAP-green fluorescent pro- tein fusion, from energy-rich and energy-poor carbon source cultures support this hypothesis. Together, these findings represent the integration of both substrate-spe- cific and global regulatory systems, and may be a bacte- rial approximation to metazoan risk-prone foraging behavior.},

@article{Rosenfeld2006,
abstract = {Quantitative in vivo measurements are essential for developing a predictive understanding of cellular behavior. Here we present a technique that converts observed fluorescence intensities into numbers of molecules. By transiently expressing a fluorescently tagged protein and then following its dilution during growth and division, we observe asymmetric partitioning of fluorescence between daughter cells at each division. Such partition asymmetries are set by the actual numbers of proteins present, and thus provide a means to quantify fluorescence levels. We present a Bayesian algorithm that infers from such data both the fluorescence conversion factor and an estimate of the measurement error. Our algorithm works for arbitrarily sized data sets and handles consistently any missing measurements. We verify the algorithm with extensive simulation and demonstrate its application to experimental data from Escherichia coli. Our technique should provide a quantitative internal calibration to systems biology studies of both synthetic and endogenous cellular networks.},

@article{Kaiser2016b,
abstract = {Bacteria adapt to changes in their environment by regulating gene expression, often at the level of transcription. However, since the molecular processes underlying gene regulation are subject to thermodynamic and other stochastic fluctuations, gene expression is inherently noisy, and identical cells in a homogeneous environment can display highly heterogeneous expression levels. To study how stochasticity affects gene regulation at the single-cell level, it is crucial to be able to directly follow gene expression dynamics in single cells under changing environmental conditions. Recently devel-oped microfluidic devices, used in combination with quantitative fluorescence time-lapse microscopy, represent a highly promising experimental approach, allowing tracking of lineages of single cells over long time-scales while simultaneously measuring their growth and gene expression. However, current devices do not allow controlled dynamical changes to the environmental conditions which are needed to study gene regulation. In addition, automated analysis of the imaging data from such devices is still highly challenging and no standard software is currently available. To address these challenges, we here present an integrated experimental and computational setup featuring, on the one hand, a new dual-input microfluidic chip which allows mixing and switching between two growth media and, on the other hand, a novel image analysis software which jointly optimizes segmentation and tracking of the cells and allows interactive user-guided fine-tuning of its results. To demonstrate the power of our approach, we study the lac operon regulation in E. coli cells grown in an environment that switches between glucose and lactose, and quantify stochastic lag times and memory at the single cell level.},

@article{Scott2014,
abstract = {Bacteria must constantly adapt their growth to changes in nutrient availability; yet despite large-scale changes in protein expression associated with sensing, adaptation, and processing different environmental nutrients, simple growth laws connect the ribosome abundance and the growth rate. Here, we investigate the origin of these growth laws by analyzing the features of ribosomal regulation that coordinate proteome-wide expression changes with cell growth in a variety of nutrient conditions in the model organism Escherichia coli. We identify supply-driven feedforward activation of ribosomal protein synthesis as the key regulatory motif maximizing amino acid flux, and autonomously guiding a cell to achieve optimal growth in different environments. The growth laws emerge naturally from the robust regulatory strategy underlying growth rate control, irrespective of the details of the molecular implementation. The study highlights the interplay between phenomenological modeling and molecular mechanisms in uncovering fundamental operating constraints, with implications for endogenous and synthetic design of microorganisms.},

@article{Ishihama2014a,
abstract = {The expression pattern of the Escherichia coli genome is controlled in part by regulating the utilization of a limited number of RNA polymerases among a total of its approximately 4,600 genes. The distribution pattern of RNA polymerase changes from modulation of two types of protein-protein interactions: the interaction of core RNA polymerase with seven species of the sigma subunit for differential promoter recognition and the interaction of RNA polymerase holoenzyme with about 300 different species of transcription factors (TFs) with regulatory functions. We have been involved in the systematic search for the target promoters recognized by each sigma factor and each TF using the newly developed Genomic SELEX system. In parallel, we developed the promoter-specific (PS)-TF screening system for identification of the whole set of TFs involved in regulation of each promoter. Understanding the regulation of genome transcription also requires knowing the intracellular concentrations of the sigma subunits and TFs under various growth conditions. This report describes the intracellular levels of 65 species of TF with known function in E. coli K-12 W3110 at various phases of cell growth and at various temperatures. The list of intracellular concentrations of the sigma factors and TFs provides a community resource for understanding the transcription regulation of E. coli under various stressful conditions in nature.},
