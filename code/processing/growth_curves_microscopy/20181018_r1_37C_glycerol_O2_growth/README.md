# 2018-10-18 Microscopy Growth Measurement

## Purpose
This experiment was performed to measure the growth rate of our cells on M9 + 0.5% glycerol.

## Strain Information
| Location | Plasmid | Genotype | Host Strain | Shorthand |
| :------- | :------ | :------- | ----------: | --------: |
| Dilution 1 - 9| - | galK<>2*O2+11-YFP, ybcN<>1-Wiggins2-lacI, gspI<>NoO1v1-CFP| HG105 | delta |


## Titration Series

| Inducer | Concentration |
| :------ | ------------: |
| Anhydrotetracycline HCl (ATC) | 0 |
| Isopropylthiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) | 0|

## Experimental Protocol

1. Cells as described in "Strain Information" were grown to saturation overnight in 3mL of LB Miller. The cells were assumed to be saturated during this time.

1. Cells were diluted 1:1000 into 3mL of M9 + 0.5% Glucose in 14mL Falcon tubes. 

2. Cells were allowed to grow for ~ 12 hours at 37°C with shaking at ~ 220 RPM.

3. The cells were removed from the shaker and diluted 1:100. A 1µL aliquot was spotted onto a M9 + 0.5% glucose + 2% agarose pad and mounted on a glass-bottom dish.

4. Ten positions were imaged for 6 hours with an image acquired every 10 minutes. One position (3) was selected for analysis.
