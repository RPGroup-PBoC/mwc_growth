# 2018-06-14 Microscopy Growth Measurement

## Purpose
This experiment was performed as a test of the microscopes at MBL. HG105 cells constitutively expressing mCherry and YFP were grown on M9 + 0.5% glucose minimal medium.

## Strain Information
| Location | Plasmid | Genotype | Host Strain | Shorthand |
| :------- | :------ | :------- | ----------: | --------: |
| Manuel 1 - XX | pZS4\*1-mCherry | ΔlacIZYA | HG105 | delta |


## Titration Series

| Inducer | Concentration |
| :------ | ------------: |
| Anhydrotetracycline HCl (ATC) | 0 |
| Isopropylthiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) | 0|

## Notes & Observations
* Cells were allowed to equilibrate on the pad under the microscope for 1.5 hours prior to growth rate measurement.

## Experimental Protocol

1. Cells as described in "Strain Information" were grown to saturation overnight in 3mL of LB Miller + antibiotic. The cells were assumed to be saturated during this time.

1. Cells were diluted 1:1000 into 3mL of M9 + 0.5% Glucose in 14mL Falcon tubes. 

2. Cells were allowed to grow for ~ 12 hours at 37°C with shaking at ~ 220 RPM.

3. The cells were removed from the shaker and diluted 1:100. A 1µL aliquot was spotted onto a M9 + 0.5% glucose + 2% agarose pad and mounted on a glass-bottom dish. 

**4**. Ten positions were imaged for 6 hours with an image acquired every 10 minutes. One position (3) was selected for analysis.
