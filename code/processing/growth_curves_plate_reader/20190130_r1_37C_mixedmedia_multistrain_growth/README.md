# 2019-01-30 37C Glucose O2 Plate Reader Growth Measurement

## Purpose
This experiment aims to measure the growth rate of the *E. coli* strains of interest at 37°C.

## Notes & Observations
* Saturated LB cultures of `deltaLacI`, `ManuelDelta`, `GenevaLE`, and `GenevaBW` were diluted 1000x into M9 + 0.5% glucose about 4 hours prior to start of measurement.
* `GenevaLE` and `GenevaBW` LB cultures (donated by the Van Valen Lab on the morning of 2019-01-29) were stored at 4˚C until dilution.
* The OD_600nm of the cultures prior to being added to the plate were: `deltaLacI`: ~0.07, `ManuelDelta`: ~0.07, `GenevaLE`: ~0.05, and `GenevaBW`: ~0.13.
* The four samples were diluted 5x into the plate.
* Measurements were taken in the Van Valen Lab Biotek Gen5 plate reader.
* The 96 well plate used had round wells and a total capacity of 250µL, with 100µL of culture added to each well.
* The plate was shaken in a linear mode at the fastest speed for the duration of the experiment.
* Measurements were taken every 7 min for 18 hours (1080 min).
* Double-sided tape was placed between the edges of the plate and the lid to prevent them rubbing and creating plastic dust.
