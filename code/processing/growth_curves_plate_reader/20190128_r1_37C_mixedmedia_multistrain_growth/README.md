# 2019-01-28 37C Mixed Media Multistrain Plate Reader Growth Measurement

## Purpose
This experiment aims to measure the growth rate of the *E. coli* strains of interest at 37°C.

## Notes & Observations
* `deltaLacI` and `ManuelDelta` were grown to saturation in LB, then diluted 1000x in M9 + 0.5% glucose about 7 hours prior to start of measurement.
* The `deltaLacI` glucose sample was diluted 50x from an OD_600nm of 0.54 into the plate.
* The `ManuelDelta` glucose sample was diluted 30x from an OD_600nm of 0.30 into the plate.
* The two strains were diluted 1000x into LB from the saturated LB cultures straight into the plate.
* Measurements were taken in the Van Valen Lab Biotek Gen5 plate reader.
* The 96 well plate used had round wells and a total capacity of 250µL, with 100µL of culture added to each well.
* The plate was shaken in a linear mode at the fastest speed for the duration of the experiment.
* Measurements were taken every 7 min for 12 hours (720 min).
