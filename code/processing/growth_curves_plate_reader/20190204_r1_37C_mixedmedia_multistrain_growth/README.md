# 2019-02-04 37C Mixed Media Multistrain Plate Reader Growth Measurement

## Purpose
This experiment aims to measure the growth rate of the *E. coli* strains of interest at 37°C.

## Notes & Observations
* Saturated LB cultures of `deltaLacI`, `ManuelDelta`, `GenevaLE`, and `GenevaBW` were diluted 1000x in M9 + 0.5% glucose about 4.5 hours prior to start of measurement.
* A saturated LB culture of `deltaLacI` was diluted 1000x into M9 + 0.5% glycerol and M9 + 0.5% acetate about 4.5 hours prior to start of measurement.
* The four glucose cultures were diluted 10x into the plate (from OD_600nm ~0.08-0.12). The glycerol and acetate cultures had OD_600nm <0.05 and were not diluted into the plate.
* `GenevaLE` and `GenevaBW` LB cultures (donated by the Van Valen Lab on the morning of 2019-01-29) were stored at 4˚C until dilution.
* Measurements were taken in the Van Valen Lab Biotek Gen5 plate reader.
* The 96 well plate used had round wells and a total capacity of 250µL, with 100µL of culture added to each well.
* The plate was shaken in a linear mode at the fastest speed for the duration of the experiment.
* Measurements were taken every 7 min for 44 hours (2640 min).
* Double-sided tape was placed between the edges of the plate and the lid to prevent them rubbing and creating plastic dust.
