# 2019-01-21 37C Glucose Multistrain Plate Reader Growth Measurement

## Purpose
This experiment aims to measure the growth rate of the *E. coli* strains of interest at 37°C.

## Notes & Observations
* `deltaLacI` (old) and `ManuelDelta` (potentially `ManuelDilution` box 1, pos 49 instead) were grown to saturation in LB + spec, then diluted 1000x in M9 + 0.5% glucose about 4.25 hours prior to start of measurement.
* Both samples were diluted 2x into the plate.
* Measurements were taken in the Murray Lab Biotek plate reader.
* The 96 well plate used had round wells and a total capacity of 250µL, with 100µL of culture added to each well.
* The plate was shaken in a linear mode at the fastest speed for the duration of the experiment.
* Measurements were taken every 7 min for 12 hours (720 min).
* Plastic dust was observed on the plate at the completion of the experiment, as well as noise in the growth curves of the center wells.
