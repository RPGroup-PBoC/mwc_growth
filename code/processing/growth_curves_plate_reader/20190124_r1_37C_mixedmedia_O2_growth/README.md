# 2019-01-24 37C Mixed Media O2 Plate Reader Growth Measurement

## Purpose
This experiment aims to measure the growth rate of the *E. coli* strains of interest at 37°C.

## Notes & Observations
* `deltaLacI` was grown to saturation in LB, then diluted 1000x in M9 + 0.5% glucose, M9 + 0.5% glycerol, and M9 + 0.5% acetate about 8.5 hours prior to start of measurement.
* The glucose sample was diluted 3x from an OD_600nm of 0.47 about an hour before measurement, and was diluted 25x from an OD_600nm of 0.25 into the plate.
* The glycerol and acetate samples were at negligible OD_600nm (<0.05) at the time of measurement and not diluted into the plate.
* Measurements were taken in the Van Valen Lab Biotek Gen5 plate reader.
* The 96 well plate used had round wells and a total capacity of 250µL, with 100µL of culture added to each well.
* The plate was shaken in a linear mode at the fastest speed for the duration of the experiment.
* Measurements were taken every 7 min for 24 hours (1440 min).
* Plastic dust was observed on the plate at the completion of the experiment, as well as noise in the growth curves of the center wells.
