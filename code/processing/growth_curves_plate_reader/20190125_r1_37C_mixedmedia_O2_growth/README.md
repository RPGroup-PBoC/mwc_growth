# 2019-01-25 37C Mixed Media O2 Plate Reader Growth Measurement

## Purpose
This experiment aims to measure the growth rate of the *E. coli* strains of interest at 37°C.

## Notes & Observations
* `deltaLacI` was grown to saturation in LB, then diluted 1000x in M9 + 0.5% glucose, M9 + 0.5% glycerol, and M9 + 0.5% acetate about 7.5 hours prior to start of measurement.
* The glucose sample was diluted 2x from an OD_600nm of 0.44 about half an hour before measurement.
* Measurements were taken in the Van Valen Lab Biotek Gen5 plate reader.
* The 96 well plate used had round wells and a total capacity of 250µL, with 100µL of culture added to each well.
* The plate was shaken in a linear mode at the fastest speed for the duration of the experiment.
* Measurements were taken every 7 min for 24 hours (1440 min).
