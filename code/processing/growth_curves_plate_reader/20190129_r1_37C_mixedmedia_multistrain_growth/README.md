# 2019-01-29 37C Mixed Media Multistrain Plate Reader Growth Measurement

## Purpose
This experiment aims to measure the growth rate of the *E. coli* strains of interest at 37°C.

## Notes & Observations
* `deltaLacI` and `ManuelDelta` were grown to saturation in LB, and diluted 1000x in M9 + 0.5% glucose about 7 hours prior to start of measurement.
* The `deltaLacI` glucose sample was diluted 30x into the plate.
* The `ManuelDelta` glucose sample was diluted 10x into the plate.
* `GenevaLE` and `GenevaBW` (donated by the Van Valen Lab) were grown in LB to saturation and diluted 1000x into M9 + 0.5% glucose straight into the plate.
* The four strains were diluted 1000x into LB from the saturated LB culture straight into the plate.
* Measurements were taken in the Van Valen Lab Biotek Gen5 plate reader.
* The 96 well plate used had round wells and a total capacity of 250µL, with 100µL of culture added to each well.
* The plate was shaken in a linear mode at the fastest speed for the duration of the experiment.
* Measurements were taken every 7 min for 18 hours (1080 min).
* Two wells and two rows were switched from their intended layout, which is reflected in the analysis.
