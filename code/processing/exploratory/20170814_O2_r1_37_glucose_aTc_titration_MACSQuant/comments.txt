# growth medium: M9 + 0.5% glucose
# growth temperature: 37 C
# Description :
# A first pass at developing the experimental protocol for a dilution-titration
# experiment.
# All cells (save for the autofluorescence control) contained a YFP molecule
# regulated by an O2+11 simple repression architecture. These cells were grown
# in M9 + 0.5% glucose minimal medium at 37°C for 8 hours prior to dilution
# and measurement. Cells were incubated with the following concentrations
# 0 ng/mL, 2 ng/mL, 4 ng/mL, 6 ng/mL, 8 ng/mL, 10 ng/mL of ATC as well as
# 0, 0.1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 75, 100, 250, 500, 1000, 5000 mM IPTG.
# Comments : Snapshots of the cells with 0 IPTG concentration revealed the
# expected behavior. The growth movie itself didn't work as expected, meaning
# that I am unable to get to protein copy number from this experiment alone.
# The flow rate was also surprisingly slow, making question the validity of
# the set entirely.
