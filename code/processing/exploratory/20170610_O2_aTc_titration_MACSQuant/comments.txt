# Equipment : MACSQuant (MBL Physiology)
# User : gchure
# growth medium: M9 + 0.5% gluocose
# growth temperature: 37 C
# Description :
# A cursory ATC titration of the lacI-mCherry dimeric fusion performed at MBL.
# All cells (save for the autofluorescence control) contained a YFP molecule
# regulated by an O2+11 simple repression architecture. These cells were grown
# in M9 + 0.5% glucose minimal medium at 37Â°C for 8 hours prior to dilution
# and measurement. Cells were incubated with the following concentrations:
# 0 ng/mL, 2 ng/mL, 3 ng/mL, 4 ng/mL, 6 ng/mL, 8 ng/mL, 10 ng/mL ATC
# Comments :
# I didn't have the strains with me, but it would have been wise to include a
# delta TetR strain such that I would have a measure of how maximally bright
# my ATC induction should be.
