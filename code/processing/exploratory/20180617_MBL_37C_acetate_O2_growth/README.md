## Purpose
HG105 cells constitutively expressing mCherry and YFP were grown on acetate substrate.

## Strain Information
| Location | Plasmid | Genotype | Host Strain | Shorthand |
| :------- | :------ | :------- | ----------: | --------: |
| Dilution 1 - 9| - | galK<>2*O2+11-YFP, ybcN<>1-lacI-mCherry, gspI<>NoO1v1-CFP| delta |


## Titration Series

| Inducer | Concentration |
| :------ | ------------: |
| Anhydrotetracycline HCl (ATC) | 0 |
| Isopropylthiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) | 0|

## Notes & Observations
* Serious drift was present in the samples, preventing use of most positions. This experiment should be repeated.

## Experimental Protocol

1. Cells as described in "Strain Information" were grown to saturation overnight in 3mL of LB Miller + antibiotic. The cells were assumed to be saturated during this time.

1. Cells were diluted 1:1000 into 3mL of M9 + 0.5% Glucose in 14mL Falcon tubes. 

2. Cells were allowed to grow for ~ 12 hours at 37°C with shaking at ~ 220 RPM.

3. The cells were removed from the shaker and diluted 1:100. A 1µL aliquot was spotted onto a M9 + 0.5% glucose + 2% agarose pad and mounted on a glass-bottom dish. 

4. Ten positions were imaged for 6 hours with an image acquired every 10 minutes. One position (3) was selected for analysis.
