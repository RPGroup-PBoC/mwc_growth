# 2018-02-16 Growth Measurement


## Purpose
This experiment is the first pass at measuring the growth rate of the *E. coli*
strains of interest in M9 + 0.5% glucose at 37°C.

## Strain information
| Location | Plasmid | Genotype | Host Strain | Shorthand |
| :------  | :------ | :------- | ----------: | --------: |
| dilutin 1 - pos. 5  | `pZS3*PN25-tetR` | `galK<>25O2+11-YFP`   | HG105 | `dilution`  |


## Titration Series

**Anhydrotetracycline HCl (ATC) concentration [ng / mL] :** 5
**Isopropylthiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) [mM] :** None

## Notes & Observations
* Initial inoculum for growth measurements was at an OD<sub>600nm</sub> ~ 0.96.

## Experimental Protocol

1. Cells from an overnight saturated LB culture were diluted 1:1000 into 3 mL  of M9 + 0.5% glucose + 5 ng/mL ATC + chloramphenicol in a 15 mL Falcon tube. The inoculum was stored at 4°C for several hours prior to the dilution.

2. Cells grew overnight at 37°C shaking at 225 RPM shielded from light to protect against photocleavage of the ATC. These cells grew for approximately 10 hours.

3. The OD<sub>600nm</sub> of these cells were measured and were diluted 1:500 into 96 mL of prewarmed M9 + 0.5% glucose + 5 ng/mL ATC + chloramphenicol and was thoroughly mixed.

4. Aliquots of 500 µL were serially pipetted to fill two 96-well plates (2 mL maximal volume). These plates were covered with breathable nylon covers and were loosely wrapped with foil.

5. These cultures were allowed to grow at 37°C while shaking at 225 RPM. Growth measurements were taken hourly unless otherwise noted.

6. Growth measurements were performed by puncturing the nylon cover with a pipette and withdrawing 500 µL of culture. This aliquot was then transferred to a plastic cuvette (2 mL maximal volume) and measured using a table-top spectrophotometer. An M9 blank was measured at each time point and used as a reference.
