# 2018-03-19 Microscopy Growth Curves

## Purpose
This experiment was designed to measure the growth rates of the maximally
expressing cells on three different carbon sources via microscopy.

## Strain Information

| Location | Plasmid | Genotype | Host Strain | Shorthand |
| :------- | :------ | :------- | ----------: | --------: |
| dilution 1 - pos. 9 | `pZS3*PN25-tetR`| `galK<>25O2+11-YFP, gspI<>4*5noO1v1-CFP` |  HG105 |`deltaLacI` |

## Titration Series

| Inducer | Concentration |
| :------ | ------------:
| Anhydrotetracycline HCl (ATC) | 0 [ng / mL] |
| Isopropylthiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) | 0 [mM] |

## Notes & Observations
* The dilution factors for glucose, glycerol, and acetate were 1:1000, 1:40, and 1:20, respectively.
* The dilutions were performed at 08h15m

## Analysis Files



## Experimental Protocol
1. Cells were diluted from a saturated overnight culture that had sat at 4°C for two days. This starting culture was warmed to room temperature for 15 minutes prior to dilution.
2. Dilutions were performed into the three different carbon sources and the cells were allowed to grow for ~8h shaking at 37°C.
3. The OD of the three cultures was measured and all were diluted to an OD<sub>600nm</sub> of ~ 0.01.
4. Aliquots of 1µl were pipetted onto 2% agarose pads containing  the appropriate carbon source and were allowed to dry for 10 - 15 minutes.
5. The pads were mounted on a glass dish and imaged. Between 5 and 10 images were taken per pad for statistical validity.
6. Brightfield images were taken every five minutes while a YFP image was taken every 15. The fluorescence images were taken for segmentation via edge detection for better measurements of cell area.
7. After imaging for several hours (XX) the images were transferred to the data backup server.
