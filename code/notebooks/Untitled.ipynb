    "It has become trivial in the era of molecular biology to label your favorite protein with a reporter that fluoresces at your favorite wavelength. Similarly, single-cell and single-molecule microscopy has become commonplace, making precise measurement of total cell fluorescence and/or localization a relatively painless procedure. However, it is still remarkably difficult to translate that precise measurement of fluorescence into the absolute copy number of your protein. \n",
    "\n",
    "By measuring the fluctuations in intensity between a mother/daughter pair after cell division, we can back calculate how bright a single molecule of interest is in arbitrary unitls, permitting the relatively easy calculation of protein copy number. We operate under the assumption that protein degradation is negligible and that protein production is ceased immediately before division. Using these assumptions, we can say that the total intensity of a given cell $I_\\text{tot}$ is related to the number of fluorescent proteins and their relative brightness,\n",
