# YEAR-MONTH-DATE TEMP CARBON OPERATOR Plate Reader Growth Measurement

## Purpose
This experiment aims to measure the growth rate of the *E. coli* strains of interest in XX at XX°C.

## Experimental Protocol

1. Cells as described in "Strain Information" were grown to saturation in 3mL of LB Miller.

2. Cells were diluted 1:1000 into 10mL of growth media in a 14mL Falcon tube.

3. 300µL of water were added to the first and last two rows and columns of a square-welled, clear-bottomed 96 well plate, the total capacity of which was 700µL. 300µL of cells were added to the remaining wells.

4. The plate was placed in a Biotek Gen5 plate reader and grown at XXC, shaking in a linear mode at the fastest speed. Measurements were taken every X minutes for approximately XX hours.
