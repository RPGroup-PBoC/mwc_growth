  Physiological Adaptability and Parametric Versatility In A Simple Genetic Circuit

Abstract: >
  The intimate relationship between the environment and cellular growth rate
  has remained a major topic of inquiry in bacterial physiology for over a
  century. Now, as it becomes possible to understand how the growth rate
  dictates the wholesale reorganization of the intracellular molecular composition, we
  can  interrogate the biophysical principles underlying this
  adaptive response. Regulation of gene expression drives this adaptation, with
  changes in growth rate tied to the activation or repression of genes covering
  enormous swaths of the genome. Here, we dissect how physiological
  perturbations alter the expression of a circuit which has been extensively
  characterized in a single physiological state. Given a complete thermodynamic
  model, we map changes in physiology directly to the biophysical parameters
  which define the expression. Controlling the growth rate via modulating the
  available carbon source or growth temperature, we measure the level of gene
  expression from a LacI-regulated promoter where the LacI copy number is
  directly measured in each condition, permitting parameter-free prediction of
  the expression level. The transcriptional output of this circuit is
  remarkably robust, with expression of the repressor being largely insensitive
  to the growth rate. The predicted gene expression quantitatively captures the
  observations under different carbon conditions, indicating that the
  biophysical parameters are indifferent to the physiology. Interestingly,
  temperature controls the expression level in ways that are inconsistent with
  the prediction, revealing temperature-dependent effects that challenge
  current models. This work exposes the strengths and weaknesses of
  thermodynamic models in fluctuating environments, posing novel challenges and
  utility in studying physiological adaptation.
Brief Summary:  >
  Cells adapt to changing environmental conditions by repressing or activating
  gene expression from enormous fractions of their genome, drastically changing
  the molecular composition of the cell. This requires the
  concerted adaptation of transcription factors to the environmental signals,
  leading to binding or releasing of their cognate sites. Here, we dissect a
  well characterized genetic circuit in a number of physiological states, make
  predictions of the response, and measure how the copy number of a regulator
  and its gene target are affected. We find the parameters defining the
  regulators behavior are remarkably robust to changes in the nutrient
  availability, but is susceptible to temperature changes. We quantitatively
  explore these two effects and discuss how they challenge current models of
  transcriptional regulation.
