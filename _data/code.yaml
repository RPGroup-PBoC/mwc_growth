- script:
  name: batch_processing.py
  desc: >
    Iterates through all preprocessed image data, parses clist.mat data,
    reconstructs linages from growth series, and computes the fold-change in
    gene expression. This script is designed to be run from the "processing"
    root folder directory. 
- script:
  name: analyze_dilution_data.py 
  desc: >
    Given compiled data mapping lineages and fold-change measurements, this
    script performs statistical inference on the fluctuations to infer the
    calibration, coupled with calculation of the repressor copy number. 
- script: 
  name: empirical_F_inference.py
  desc: > 
    Given measurements of the fold-change in gene expression, this script infers
    the posterior distribution of the observed free energy.
- script: 
  name: entropic_parameter_inference.py
  desc: >
    Infers the entropic parameters $$\Delta S_R$$ and $$\Delta S_{AI}$$ from a
    collection of fold-change measurements at different temperatures. This can
    be run on all data simultaneously or on individual temperatures by toggling
    the "pooled" variable at the top of the script. 
- script:
  name: DNA_binding_energy_estimation.py
  desc: >
    Infers an effective DNA binding energy $$\epsilon$$ from a collection of
    fold-change measurements. 
- script:
  name: systematic_error_binding_energy_inference.py
  desc: 
    Infers an effective DNA binding energy $$\epsilon$$ under a variety of
    scenarios where cell size is considered.
- script:
  name: calibration_factor.stan
  desc: >
    Inferrential model for estimation of the calibration factor given sibling
    cell intensities
- script:
  name: DNA_binding_energy.stan
  desc: >
    Inferrential model for the estimation of the DNA binding energy given
    fold-change measurements
- script: 
  name: empirical_F_inference.stan
  desc: >
    Inferrential model for the estimation of the free energy from fold-change
    measurements. 
- script: 
  name: entropy_estimation.stan
  desc: > 
    Inferrenetial model for inferring the entropic parameters $$\Delta S_R$$ and
    $$\Delta S_{AI}$$ for a single temperature. 
- script: 
  name: pooled_entropy_estimation.stan
  desc: >
    Inferrential model for the estimation of the entropic parameters $$\Delta
    S_R$$ and $$\Delta S_{AI}$$ for multiple temperatures together.
